# Fit Analyzer Next

This project is a web application for analyzing FIT files using Next.js for the frontend and a Python backend. The application allows users to upload FIT files, which are then processed to extract various metrics related to fitness activities.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

### Frontend

The frontend is built using Next.js and React. It includes the following key components:

- **FileUpload**: A component for uploading FIT files.
- **AnalysisResults**: A component for displaying the results of the FIT file analysis.
- **Pages**: The main application pages, including the home page where users can upload files and view results.

### Backend

The backend is implemented in Python using Flask. It handles file uploads and processes the FIT files using the `fitparse` library. The backend exposes an API endpoint that the frontend can call to submit FIT files and receive analysis results.

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

## Deployment

This project is configured to be deployed on Vercel. Ensure that the `vercel.json` file is properly set up with the necessary environment variables and build settings.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Use the file upload component to select and upload a FIT file.
3. View the analysis results displayed on the page.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue for any enhancements or bug fixes.
